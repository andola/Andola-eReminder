		<h3>H.	GRANT OF LICENSE TO Andolasoft</h3> 
		<p><b>As between you and Andolasoft, you exclusively own all rights in and to the Contributions that you submit to the Site.</b> Andolasoft needs a limited license from you so that we can use your Contributions to make the Services and Site available to you.  For example, if you upload product specifications, product drawings or a animated graphic presentation of how a product works to the Site, we need a license from you to display, perform and distribute these Contributions in order to make these Contributions available to you on your project pages.  And, if you permit third parties (such as your customers or consultants) to view your project pages, we need to have a license to sub-license your Contributions to these third parties so that they can view and use your group pages.</p> 
		<p>By making a Contribution to the Site, you grant to Andolasoft a limited, perpetual, non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your Contribution to anyone else in addition to Andolasoft), fully-paid, royalty-free (meaning that Andolasoft is not required to pay you to use your Contribution), sub-licensable (subject to the restrictions below), transferable (solely because we need the right to transfer this license to a successor Site operator) and worldwide (because the Internet and the Site are global in reach) license to use, modify, perform, display, reproduce and distribute the Contribution <b>for the sole purpose of operating the Site and Services</b>.  Andolasoft needs the right to “modify” and “reproduce” your Content, because the software and servers hosting the Site modify and reproduce your Content automatically in order to make the Site available.</p> 
		<p>We will only sublicense your Contribution for the following purposes:  (1) to make your Contributions available to any third party (such as a client or a contractor) that you permit to view your project pages on the Site; and (2) to permit a third party hosted services provider to host the Site.</p>
